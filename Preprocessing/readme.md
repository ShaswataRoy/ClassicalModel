A list of instructions to reiterate the preprocessing step:
 
1. Copy the contents from the folder Roy/datamine-2022. Run the first 3 sections of prepare_data.ipynb on Anvil Jupyter notebook
3. Run the first 2 cells of section 4
4. Run the third cell in the cluster by executing the command "sbatch myjobsubmissionfile.sh" in the terminal
5. Before going into steps 5 and 6 we need to go into the singularity environment using the command: "singularity shell ingenii.sif"
6. Run step 5 using "python3 step_5.py"
7. Run step 6 using "python3 step_6.py"
